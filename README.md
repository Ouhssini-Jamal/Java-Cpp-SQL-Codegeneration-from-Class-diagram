# Code Generation App: Java, C++, and SQL
## Overview

The Code Generation App is a versatile tool designed to automate software development by generating Java, C++, and SQL code from class diagrams. This application simplifies coding tasks by allowing users to input class details, including attributes, methods, and relationships, through an intuitive interface. The app then sends this data to an API, which processes the information and generates code files. 

The generated code is thoroughly checked for syntax accuracy using an XML file.The frontend, developed using ReactJS, Redux, HTML, and CSS, employs Axios to make HTTP requests to the backend. The backend is powered by a Spring Boot API, where it processes these requests and provides responses.
